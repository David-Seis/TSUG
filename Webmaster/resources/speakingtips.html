				<h2>Public Speaking Tips for Technical Topics - Effectively communicating with technical professionals</h2>
				<p>Thanks for being willing to speak with our User Group! Our members are looking forward to your session. We are an in-person meeting group, and our members travel from many locations - some of them quite distant. It's important that you treat their time with respect, and deliver the best information you can. This article can help you do that.</p>
				<p>Whether you are an experienced speaker or brand-new to talking in front of others, there are some skills that you need to communicate effectively. There's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDcDLpIjcFg" target = "_blank">a quick, free video you can watch here for some great training</a>.</p>
				<p>In general, you should cover three areas when you speak, and in this order:</p>
				<p><b>What</b> you are talking about</p>
				<p><b>Why</b> the audience should care about it</p>
				<p><b>How</b> it works</p>
				<br>
				<p>You don't have to use these specific words as headings of course, but you should use these words as your session's roadmap. Read on to find out more!</p>

		<!-- The What  Section -->
		<section id="about" class="py-5">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Tip 1: Introduce yourself and tell us <b>What</b> you are talking about</h2>
				<p>All of us have a suspicion when we're up in front of a technical group that we might mess up, or that the people in the audience might know more than us and ask a question we can't answer. That's a normal feeling, and it's completely OK. However, people came to see you on purpose - they will be respectful and they want to learn. The odds are that since you have put together a session, you know more about the topic than they do - or at least you know one or two things that might be new to them. </p>
				<p>Even so, it's best to give a quick introduction of yourself and why you are a good person for this topic. Stay positive - don't make fun of yourself or explain how you aren't an expert. you are on the stage, so you are the expert. Do tell us your background, and how long you have been working with the topic.</p>
				<p>Next, tell us what this is. Give us a frame of reference, explain how you got it, what it is used for, and where it fits.</p>
				<p>For instance, explaining a database feature might be something like,</p>p>
					<p><i>Hello, I'm Buck, and I have been working with lots of databases for many years. The Vector functions in SQL Server are useful because they provide a new way of working with data beyond just text and numbers. Our topic today is "An Overview of Vector Databases", and in this talk you'll learn more about what Vectors are, why they are important, and I'll show you a practical example of working with them.</i></p>

		<!-- The Why Section -->
		<section id="about" class="py-5">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Tip 2: Tell me <b>Why</b> this is important</h2>
				<p>Now that we know who you are and what we are talking about, explain why it is important to know. This can be something like "and this will help you search faster" or "this feature works with AI in the following way" or "you can use this information to explain to your boss why you should upgrade".  </p>
				<p>The point in this section is to explain why the audience should put the effort in to listen to the rest of your presentation. If you just start talking about how to do something - especially if it is complicated - folks don't always care about your topic enough to follow along.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<!-- The How Section -->
		<section id="about" class="py-5">
			<div class="container">
				<h2>Tip 3: Tell me <b>How</b> this works</h2>
				<p>This is the part many speakers jump right into instead of the <i>What</i> and the <i>Why</i> sections. However, if you start with those two sections first, this section makes a lot more sense. You are telling a story.</p>
				<p>As you begin the <i>How</i> section, pick a "flow". You have a few to choose from.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Process</i> flow uses steps. You explain that we start with doing a step, and then we do the next step, and so on. This is the most-used flow for most technical talks.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Chronological</i> flow focuses on the timeline. You might say, "First, this happened, then this, and finally, this." This is good for explaining the history of a technology, how a feature evolved, or a sequence of events that leads to a result.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Problem-Solution</i> flow highlights a challenge and then demonstrates how to overcome it. You present a problem, then walk through the steps to resolve it. This is useful for troubleshooting sessions or demonstrating a tool's capabilities.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Comparative</i> flow shows how two or more things work, showing their similarities and differences. You can compare coding approaches, a couple of software tools, or methodologies. This helps us understand the differences you want to show and helps us make informed decisions.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Component-Based</i> flow breaks down a system or concept into its individual parts and explains how each part functions and interacts. In this flow you cover each piece individually, then show us how they work together as a whole. This is great for explaining complex systems or architectures.</p>
				
				<p>A <i>Use-Case</i> flow illustrates how a feature or tool is applied in a specific scenario. Here you walk through a real-world example, showing us how the "how" works in practice. This helps us see the practical applications of what you're presenting.</p>
				
				<p>Remember, the best flow depends on your topic and your style. Choose the one that will make your "how" the clearest and most engaging to us. A flow will help keep you from jumping around the topic and confusing us.</p>

				<p>Remember to recap your main points, and include a URL to some site you have that lists all your resources. You can create these as you build your session.</p>
