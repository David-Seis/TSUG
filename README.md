<b>Address: </b><a href="https://www.bing.com/maps?&mepi=109~~TopOfPage~Address_Link&ty=18&q=iO%20Associates%20-%20Tampa&ss=ypid.YN873x17311666291203835826&ppois=27.94316864013672_-82.4468002319336_iO%20Associates%20-%20Tampa_YN873x17311666291203835826~&cp=27.943169~-82.4468&v=2&sV=1"> 615 Channelside Dr, Tampa, FL 33602</a>

<p>There is parking just accross the street - it's just 2$ an hour, so very inexpensive for the area. 
The Port Tampa Bay parking garage is <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=810+Channelside+Drive&aqs=edge..69i57j69i11004&FORM=ANCMS9&PC=U531">located across the street from the central cruise terminal:</p>
<p>Port Tampa Bay Cruise Terminal 3 ‚Äì 815 Channelside Drive, Tampa, Florida 33602)</a>.</p>  

<p>Signs on-site also direct cruise passengers to long term parking, but turn into the area that says "Short Term Parking".</p>

<p>You'll find lots to do in this area, from <a href="https://sparkmanwharf.com/">Sparkman Wharf</a> to <a href="https://yborcityonline.com/">Ybor City</a> if you want to come early, stay late, or bring your family!</p>
